Food Security: Ensuring everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious food is a key challenge. This project seeks to predict food hamper demand and help organizations optimize resource allocation.
Feature Selection: By analyzing factors such as income levels, family size, and location, we identified key variables influencing food hamper requests.
Model Evaluation: We used various metrics to evaluate our prediction model, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data and provides reliable forecasts for future donations.
Deployment Obstacles: Scalability, security, and system integration are just a few of the challenges that come with deploying machine learning models to commercial settings. Addressing these issues required cross-team collaboration and technical expertise.
The project sheds light on food security issues and demonstrates how data science can improve community outreach and food distribution efforts.

The goal of this research is to predict food hamper demand in communities. Using machine learning techniques, we forecast the number of food hampers needed in various regions based on demographic factors, historical donation data, and community needs.
The project involves three main stages: data cleaning and exploration, predictive modeling, and deployment. During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we preprocess the data, identify trends, and investigate correlations between variables like income, family size, and location.
The machine learning phase involves constructing models to predict food hamper demand, potentially categorizing areas by their level of need. In the deployment phase, the prediction model will be made available to food banks for real-time forecasting and more efficient food distribution.
