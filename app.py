Food Security: Ensuring everyone has access to sufficient, nutritious food is a key challenge. This project seeks to predict food hamper demand and help organizations optimize resource allocation.
Feature Selection: By analyzing factors such as income levels, family size, and location, we identified key variables influencing food hamper requests.
Model Evaluation: We used various metrics to evaluate our prediction model, ensuring it generalizes well to unseen data and provides reliable forecasts for future donations.
Deployment Challenges: We focused on ensuring scalability and accuracy, integrating the predictive models with local food bank systems to streamline food distribution.
The project sheds light on food security issues and demonstrates how data science can enhance community outreach and food distribution efforts.

  The goal of this research is to predict food hamper demand in communities. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to forecast the number of food hampers needed in various regions based on demographic factors, historical donation data, and community needs.
  The project involves three primary stages: data cleaning and exploration, predictive modeling, and deployment. In the EDA phase, we clean and preprocess the data, identify trends and patterns, and investigate correlations between various features like income, family size, and location.
  During the machine learning phase, we build models to predict the number of food hampers required in each community. We may also categorize areas based on the level of need (e.g., low, medium, high demand).
  Finally, in the deployment phase, the predictive model will be accessible to local food banks through a web application, enabling real-time forecasting and more efficient food distribution.
